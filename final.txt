1) 2 button up down 

the button func up or down change the degree for ( 5 degree) .

we have const val for temperature 
1) max temp = 75 
2) min temp = 35
3) init temp= 60  ---> for EEPROM
4) take temp from user --> EEPROM

2) in ON-off specification :

1 ) button for on and off 
2 ) on or off for all the system power --> i.e (display ,power to heater)
i think --> ( we need ext interrupt ) . -->(in next upgrade)


3) Specifications- temperature sensing

reading the temp every 100 ms (by boling) 
next upgrade --> (using timer interrupt) 

we have two temp :
1- state that be set --> ( from up or down button ) or ( ideal temp)
2- the actual state of temp reading 

NOTE : after reading 10 time and take the (avr) turn off or on -->60 off

heating on if the temp less than the set temp by -5 deg			
colling ON // //   //   greater than		//+5	//


4)
one led for heating :
1 if heating blink every 1 sec 
2 ifcooling led on with out blinking --> on
